# Scene

Scene is a weekend project of mine, putting together a social communications app for the iPhone.

Scene is intended to be kind of like Twitter, but with a more straightforward and simple interface. Scene is inherently location-based; when you post something, your current location is added to your message. When you look at messages others have posted, your current location is used to retrieve messages, returned by their proximity to you.

Scene is free software; the iPhone application source code is available under the GNU General Public License, version 3. The web application source code (written for the Python runtime of Google's App Engine) is available under the Apache License, version 2.0.
